# Specification Quality Checklist: 首页动态 Feed 显示系统

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All items PASS** - Specification is ready for planning phase

## Notes

- Specification includes 3 prioritized user stories (P1-P2) covering core feed loading, pagination, and refresh flows
- 10 functional requirements provide clear contracts for feed query implementation
- Success criteria focus on performance (< 1 second load) and consistency (no duplicates, no gaps)
- Key decision: Temporal ordering only, no ML-based recommendations in Phase 1 (planned for Phase 2)
- Dependencies: Requires User Follow System (004) and Post Publishing System (001) to be operational
- Denormalized counts (like_count, comment_count) included for performance
- Cursor-based pagination pattern ensures stable results even during concurrent updates

**Status**: READY FOR NEXT PHASE (`/speckit.plan`)
