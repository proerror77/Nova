# Specification Quality Checklist: 贴文互动系统（点赞与评论）

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All items PASS** - Specification is ready for planning phase

## Notes

- Specification includes 3 prioritized user stories (P1-P2) covering like toggle, comment submission, and comment deletion
- 11 functional requirements provide complete contracts for interaction implementation
- Key decision: Like toggle (no separate unlike), 300-character comment limit, unique constraint on (user_id + post_id) for likes
- Comment deletion: Either comment author or post author can delete (dual permission model)
- Notification triggering integrated: triggers notification system when post author receives like/comment
- Performance targets: Like/unlike < 500ms, comments appear < 1 second
- Duplicate prevention: Database uniqueness constraint prevents race conditions
- Dependencies: Requires Post Publishing System (001) and Notification System (005)
- Comment sorting: Consistent ordering by created_at (oldest or newest first, configurable)

**Status**: READY FOR NEXT PHASE (`/speckit.plan`)
