# Specification Quality Checklist: Video Live Streaming Infrastructure

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - All items completed

### Summary

- **Total Requirements**: 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012)
- **Total Success Criteria**: 10 measurable outcomes (SC-001 through SC-010)
- **User Stories**: 3 prioritized stories (P1, P1, P2)
- **Key Entities**: 5 entities defined
- **Edge Cases**: 5 edge cases documented
- **Assumptions**: 10 reasonable assumptions documented

### Quality Observations

1. **Requirements Clarity**: All functional requirements use MUST language and specify testable behaviors
2. **Success Criteria Quality**: All success criteria include measurable metrics (time, percentage, count)
3. **User Story Independence**: Each user story can be tested and deployed independently
4. **Scope Clarity**: Clear boundaries with VOD, DRM, and ultra-low-latency explicitly out of scope
5. **No Clarification Markers**: Spec uses industry-standard defaults; no ambiguities remain

## Notes

- Specification ready for planning phase
- No rework required before `/speckit.plan`
- All success criteria are verifiable without implementation details
