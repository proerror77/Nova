## Overview

This document contains all implementation tasks organized by phase and user story. Each task is independently actionable and includes file paths, dependencies, and success criteria.

### 🚨 Critical Path Adjustments for Actual Architecture

**Note**: Original spec assumed 5 independent microservices. Current implementation is a pragmatic hybrid:

**Actual Component Mapping:**
```
Original Spec          →  Actual Implementation
────────────────────────────────────────────────
streaming-ingest       →  Nginx-RTMP (external) + stream_service.rs
streaming-transcode    →  Nginx-RTMP bitrate profiles (external)
streaming-delivery     →  CloudFront CDN (external) + REST API
streaming-api          →  user-service/handlers
streaming-core         →  models.rs + repository.rs + redis_counter.rs
```

**Key Decision Points Needing Clarity:**

1. **WebSocket Real-Time Hub (Critical Gap)**
   - Spec assumes independent websocket_hub service
   - Current: No real-time WebSocket support
   - **Action**: Add websocket_handler.rs to user-service for live viewer count updates

2. **Event Streaming (Medium Gap)**
   - Spec assumes Kafka for inter-service communication
   - Current: No Kafka integration
   - **Action**: Optional - add Kafka producer for audit trail (not critical for MVP)

3. **Monitoring & Observability (Medium Gap)**
   - Spec assumes Prometheus export + dashboard
   - Current: No monitoring infrastructure
   - **Action**: Add prometheus_exporter.rs + basic dashboard

### User Story Priorities

- **P1 (Critical MVP)**: Broadcaster initiates stream + Viewer watches stream
- **P2 (Important)**: Analytics and monitoring

### Execution Strategy

**MVP Scope (Weeks 1-2)**: Complete P1 stories only
- Users can broadcast via RTMP
- Users can watch via HLS/DASH
- Basic error handling + graceful shutdown

**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Add P2 (Analytics)
- Real-time metrics via WebSocket
- Historical analytics queries
- Dashboard support

**Recommended Parallelization**: Within each story, run tests in parallel with implementation

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Broadcaster Initiates Live Stream (P1)

### User Story Description
A content creator connects their encoder (OBS, FFmpeg) via RTMP to the streaming server and begins streaming. The system accepts the connection, validates the streaming key, normalizes the bitrate, and makes the stream available to viewers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Broadcaster with valid streaming key connects RTMP encoder → server accepts connection → stream ingested
2. RTMP stream with fluctuating bitrate → system adapts output streams to available quality levels
3. Broadcaster stops streaming → connection closes → system notifies all viewers within 2 seconds

### Independent Test Criteria (US1 MVP)
- RTMP server accepts connections on port 1935
- Streaming key validation works (valid key accepted, invalid key rejected)
- Bitrate adaptation produces 3 quality levels (480p, 720p, 1080p)
- Stream transitions to ACTIVE state in database within 1 second
- Stream cleanup completes within 2 seconds after encoder disconnects

## Dependency Graph

### Critical Path (Must Complete in Order)

```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Foundational)

Phase 3 (US1: Broadcaster) + Phase 4 (US2: Viewer) [Can run in parallel]
    ↓
Phase 5 (US3: Analytics)
    ↓
Phase 6 (Polish & Ops)
```

### Within-Phase Parallelization

**Phase 3 (US1) Parallel Tasks**: T024, T025, T026 (database), T027-T036 (ingestion service) can start once T024-T026 complete

- **Week 1**: Phases 1-2 (Setup + Foundational) + Phase 3 (US1) database & RTMP infrastructure
- **Week 2**: Phase 3 completion (RTMP ingest) + Phase 4 (HLS/DASH delivery) + integration tests

**Success Criteria**:
- RTMP ingest works (FFmpeg → streaming server)
- HLS/DASH delivery works (browser → playback)
- 100 concurrent streams sustainable
- 10k concurrent viewers with <3s startup
- Zero data loss during delivery

### Phase 2 Scope (Weeks 3-4)
**Target**: Add P2 user story (Analytics)

**Tasks**:
- Phase 5 complete (metrics collection, WebSocket, API)
- Dashboard functional
- Historical analytics queryable
- Prometheus metrics exposed

### Polish & Launch (Week 5)
**Target**: Phase 6 (error handling, security, monitoring, documentation)

**Deliverables**:
- Production-ready Kubernetes manifests
- Security audit passed
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation complete
- Deployment runbook ready
