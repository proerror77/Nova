## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - Broadcaster Initiates Live Stream (Priority: P1)

A content creator wants to start broadcasting their video stream to an audience. They connect their encoder (OBS, FFmpeg, etc.) using RTMP protocol to the streaming server and begin streaming video + audio.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational capability - without broadcasters being able to stream, viewers have nothing to watch. This is the critical MVP requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a broadcaster connecting an encoder, streaming content, and confirming the stream is ingested and made available to viewers within 3 seconds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a broadcaster with a valid streaming key, **When** they connect an RTMP encoder, **Then** the server accepts the connection and begins ingesting video/audio stream
2. **Given** an active RTMP stream, **When** the bitrate fluctuates, **Then** the system automatically adapts the output streams to available quality levels
3. **Given** a broadcaster stops streaming, **When** the connection closes, **Then** the system gracefully terminates the stream and notifies all viewers within 2 seconds

---

### User Story 2 - Viewer Watches Live Stream (Priority: P1)

A viewer discovers a live stream and wants to watch it on their preferred device. They select their desired quality, click play, and begin watching with minimal startup delay.

**Why this priority**: This is equally critical to broadcasting - viewers are the audience and core value driver. Stream availability means nothing without viewers.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by a viewer opening the stream URL, selecting quality, and confirming video playback starts within 3 seconds with acceptable quality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active broadcast stream, **When** a viewer opens the HLS/DASH stream URL, **Then** playback begins within 3 seconds
2. **Given** a viewer with varying network conditions, **When** the connection quality changes, **Then** the stream automatically adjusts bitrate without noticeable interruption (buffer <2 seconds)
3. **Given** multiple concurrent viewers, **When** up to 10,000+ viewers join simultaneously, **Then** all viewers maintain stable playback quality

---

### User Story 3 - Analytics and Monitoring (Priority: P2)

Platform operators and broadcasters want to monitor stream health, viewer engagement, and system performance in real-time. They need metrics like concurrent viewer count, bandwidth usage, quality switches, and error rates.

**Why this priority**: Important for operational visibility and long-term platform optimization, but not required for MVP. Broadcasters primarily care about "is my stream working" initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by confirming analytics data is collected for active streams (viewer count, bitrate, quality changes) and is accessible via WebSocket or API within 1-2 seconds of events occurring.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active stream, **When** the analytics system collects metrics, **Then** real-time counts (viewers, bitrate, dropped frames) are available within 1-2 seconds
2. **Given** a viewer quality switch, **When** the bitrate adaptation occurs, **Then** the event is logged and reflected in analytics immediately
3. **Given** a platform operator viewing the dashboard, **When** they select a stream, **Then** they see current metrics (concurrent viewers, health score, bandwidth) updated in real-time

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a broadcaster's encoder connection drops mid-stream? (Stream should terminate gracefully, viewers should be notified within 2 seconds)
- How does the system handle a viewer with extremely poor network conditions? (Graceful degradation to lower bitrates, eventual buffering or disconnect if network is insufficient)
- What happens when concurrent viewer count exceeds 10,000? (System should remain stable; document the maximum supported concurrency)
- How does the system handle RTMP streams with variable or extremely high bitrates? (Automatic bitrate capping and transcoding to standardized quality levels)
- What happens when a viewer attempts to join a stream that has ended? (Return appropriate error/unavailable state)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept RTMP streams from encoders and validate stream format (video codec H.264, audio codec AAC minimum)
- **FR-002**: System MUST ingest RTMP streams at various bitrates and normalize them into standard quality levels (480p, 720p, 1080p)
- **FR-003**: System MUST output HLS segments (.m3u8 playlist + .ts segments) compatible with major browsers and mobile devices
- **FR-004**: System MUST output DASH MPD manifest and segments for devices supporting DASH protocol
- **FR-005**: System MUST support adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) - automatically selecting bitrate based on viewer bandwidth
- **FR-006**: System MUST broadcast stream availability/status changes to viewers via WebSocket in real-time
- **FR-007**: System MUST collect and expose analytics metrics (concurrent viewers, bandwidth, quality switches, errors) via WebSocket or REST API
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce CDN integration for geographic content distribution and reduced latency
  - **Clarification**: HLS/DASH segments served via CDN origin (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) with Cache-Control headers (10min TTL for segments, 1min for manifests)
  - **Routing**: Delivery service returns CDN-prefixed URLs in playlists (e.g., https://cdn.example.com/hls/stream-123/480p/segment-1.ts instead of direct server URL)
  - **Measurement**: Monitor viewer latency from edge nodes; baseline: direct server delivery vs. CDN delivery; target: 30% reduction per SC-010
- **FR-009**: System MUST support broadcasting authentication and authorization (valid streaming keys, permission validation)
- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully handle broadcaster disconnection and stream termination within 2 seconds
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain stream state consistency across distributed infrastructure (multiple edge nodes, CDN nodes)
  - **Clarification**: All services (ingestion, transcoding, delivery) must ensure eventual consistency of stream state within 500ms using distributed consensus (PostgreSQL advisory locks or Redis) + Kafka event ordering by stream_id partition
  - **State Transitions**: PENDING_INGEST → ACTIVE → ENDED_GRACEFULLY | ERROR must be atomic across all service replicas
  - **Failure Scenario**: If transcoding service crashes mid-stream, delivery service must not serve stale segments; ingestion service must detect timeout and transition stream to ERROR state within 5 seconds
- **FR-012**: System MUST log all streaming events (connect, quality switch, disconnect, errors) for auditing and debugging

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.

- **SC-007**: Stream health is accurately reported to all viewers within 2 seconds of state changes
- **SC-008**: Analytics metrics (concurrent viewers, bitrate, quality) are updated and available within 1-2 seconds of occurrence
- **SC-009**: System remains operational during broadcaster disconnection/reconnection cycles without affecting other active streams
- **SC-010**: CDN integration reduces average viewer latency by 30% compared to direct server delivery

## Assumptions

1. **Encoder Support**: Broadcasters will use standard RTMP-compatible encoders (OBS, FFmpeg, Wirecast, etc.); custom encoder support is out of scope
2. **Network Conditions**: System assumes viewers have internet connections capable of at least 480p (2 Mbps) streaming; the system will degrade gracefully below this
3. **Authentication**: Streaming key generation and management are provided by a separate authentication service; this spec assumes valid keys are available
4. **Geographic Distribution**: CDN provider (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai) is already contracted and available; integration points are defined but CDN platform specifics are out of scope
5. **Video Codecs**: System will standardize on H.264 video + AAC audio; other codecs are not in initial scope
6. **Storage**: Stream archival/VOD (Video on Demand) is out of scope; focus is on live-only delivery
7. **DRM**: Copy protection / DRM (Digital Rights Management) is not required for initial launch
8. **Latency Class**: Target is "low latency" (5-10 second end-to-end delay), not ultra-low-latency (RTMP-to-viewer in milliseconds)
9. **Multi-bitrate Transcoding**: System assumes backend has sufficient compute to transcode to 3-5 quality levels in real-time
10. **Concurrent Stream Limit**: Initial deployment supports exactly 100 concurrent broadcast streams (MVP limit); per-stream viewer limit is 10,000+ concurrent viewers

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Stream ingestion latency <5s, viewer startup <3s, quality adaptation <2s
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ concurrent broadcasts, 10k+ concurrent viewers per stream
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for active streams (except during planned maintenance)
- **Reliability**: Zero data loss during stream delivery; graceful error handling for transient network issues
- **Security**: RTMP connections require valid streaming keys; HTTPS/TLS for all management APIs and viewer connections
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection and alerting for stream health, errors, and anomalies
