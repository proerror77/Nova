## Daily Standup Structure

**Time**: 09:00 UTC | **Duration**: 15 minutes | **Format**: Synchronous (all required)

### Standup Agenda
1. **2 min**: Progress against daily tasks
2. **2 min**: Blockers + dependencies
3. **1 min**: Help requests
4. **5 min**: Tech discussion (if needed)
5. **5 min**: Next day preparation

### Blockers Escalation
- **Red blocker** (blocks team): Engineer A notified immediately, target resolution <4h
- **Yellow blocker** (blocks individual): Tag owner + team, target resolution <1 day
- **Green** (minor): Async Slack discussion

---

## Code Review SLA

| Type | Reviewer | Deadline | Criteria |
|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Feature PR | Tech Lead (A) | 24h | Design, tests, perf impact |
| Hotfix | Any senior | 4h | Correctness, no regressions |
| Documentation | Async | 48h | Clarity, accuracy |
| Test suite | QA Lead + Engineer | 12h | Coverage, edge cases |

---

## Risk Mitigation & Contingency

### Risk 1: E2E Encryption Complexity (Week 6-7)
**Mitigation**:
- Engineer B starts POC in Week 5
- Pair programming with Engineer A during Week 6
- Fallback: Use industry-standard libsodium wrapper (pre-built)

### Risk 2: WebSocket Load Testing (Week 7)
**Mitigation**:
- Engineer C builds load test framework early (Week 5)
- Early testing with 10k, then 50k concurrent
- Fallback: Use ready-made load testing tools (k6, locust)

### Risk 3: Schedule Slip (Any week)
**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize: T211 (messaging) > T212 (API) > T213 (WebSocket) > T214 > T215
- If at risk, defer advanced features (Week 10) to after launch
- Cross-team support: redistribute tasks if needed
