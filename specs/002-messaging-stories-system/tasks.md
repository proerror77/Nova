# Tasks: Phase 7B - Messaging + Stories System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-messaging-stories-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (tech stack: Rust/Tokio/axum, TypeScript/React), spec.md (8 user stories P1-P3), research.md (technology decisions), data-model.md (10 entities)

**Organization**: Tasks are organized by **TDD Phase** (Unit Tests ‚Üí Integration Tests ‚Üí Implementation) within each user story. This ensures tests are written before implementation, following red-green-refactor discipline.

## Path Conventions

- Backend (messaging): `backend/messaging-service/src/`
- Backend (stories): `backend/story-service/src/`
- Backend (search): `backend/search-service/src/`
- Backend (notifications): `backend/notification-service/src/`
- Shared Rust crypto lib: `backend/libs/crypto-core/`
- Frontend: `frontend/src/`
- Tests: `backend/<service>/tests/`
- Migrations: `backend/<service>/migrations/`

Note: For existing tasks that reference `backend/user-service/...`, apply the following mapping by feature area at implementation time:
- US1/US2/US5/US6/US7/US8 ‚Üí `backend/messaging-service/...`
- US4 (Stories) ‚Üí `backend/story-service/...`
- US3 (Search) ‚Üí `backend/search-service/...`
- Mentions/Notifications endpoints ‚Üí `backend/notification-service/...`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - **BLOCKS all user stories**
- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - US1+US2 (P1): Should complete first for MVP
  - US3-5 (P2): Can run in parallel with US1/US2
  - US6-8 (P3): Can run after US1 or in parallel if capacity
  - Advanced features (P3): After all core stories done
- **NFR + Polish (Phase 12-14)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### Within Each User Story: TDD Order

1. **Unit Tests** (3A, 4A, etc.): Red phase - write failing tests
2. **Database & Models** (3B, 4B, etc.): Foundation for implementation
3. **Services** (3C, 4C, etc.): Green phase - implement to pass tests
4. **REST API** (3D, 4D, etc.): Integration with HTTP layer
5. **WebSocket** (3E, 4E, etc.): Real-time features
6. **Frontend** (3F, 4F, etc.): UI implementation
7. **Integration Tests** (3G, 4G, etc.): Refactor phase - comprehensive validation

---

## Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 Setup**:
- T002 (Rust deps) and T003 (TS deps) can run in parallel

**Phase 2 Foundational**:
- T009-T014 (infrastructure unit tests) can run in parallel
- T016-T024 (infrastructure implementation) can run in parallel (after tests pass)

**Phase 3+ User Stories**:
- All 3A (unit tests) can run in parallel
- All 3B (database) can run in parallel
- All 3C (services) depend on 3B, can run in parallel
- All 3D-G can run in parallel once dependencies met
