# Tasks: Phase 7B - Messaging + Stories System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-messaging-stories-system/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (tech stack: Rust/Tokio/axum, TypeScript/React), spec.md (8 user stories P1-P3), research.md (technology decisions), data-model.md (10 entities)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story in parallel.

## Path Conventions

- **Backend**: `backend/user-service/src/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/`
- **Tests**: `backend/user-service/tests/`
- **Migrations**: `backend/user-service/migrations/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-10)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - US1+US2 (P1): Should complete first for MVP
  - US3-5 (P2): Can run in parallel with US1/US2
  - US6-8 (P3): Can run after US1 or in parallel if capacity
  - Advanced features (P3): After all core stories done
- **Polish (Phase 11-12)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Direct Messages)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1 - Group Conversations)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1 infrastructure but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2 - Search)**: Can start after Foundational - Builds on US1/US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2 - Stories)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of messaging features
- **User Story 5 (P2 - Reactions)**: Can start after US1/US4 - Depends on message/story models
- **User Story 6 (P3 - Edit/Delete)**: Can start after US1 - Depends on message model
- **User Story 7 (P3 - Offline Queue)**: Can start after US1 - Builds on message send logic
- **User Story 8 (P3 - Analytics)**: Can start after US1/US2 - Depends on conversation/message models

### Within Each User Story

- Database migrations before models
- Models before services
- Services before API endpoints
- API endpoints before WebSocket handlers
- WebSocket handlers before frontend components
- Frontend components before testing

### Parallel Opportunities

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 + 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (1 week)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (1 week) - **CRITICAL - blocks all stories**
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Direct Messages) (2 weeks)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Group Conversations) (1 week)
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Both stories fully functional and tested independently
6. Deploy/demo to stakeholders (Week 5 end goal)

**MVP Scope**: Users can send and receive 1:1 and group messages in real-time with persistence, offline support, and E2E encryption. This delivers core messaging value without search or stories.

### Incremental Delivery (Full Phase 7B)

1. Weeks 5-6: Setup + Foundational + US1
2. Week 7: US1 validated + US2 complete
3. Weeks 7-8: US2 validated + US3 (Search) + US4 (Stories) in parallel
4. Weeks 8-9: US3 + US4 validated + US5 (Reactions) + US6 (Edit/Delete) in parallel
5. Weeks 9-10: US5 + US6 validated + US7 (Offline) + US8 (Analytics) in parallel
6. Weeks 10-11: All stories validated, begin Polish
7. Weeks 11-12: Performance testing, security hardening, launch prep

**Incremental Value**:
- Week 7: Core messaging (US1+US2) ‚úì
- Week 8: + Search + Stories (US3+US4) ‚úì
- Week 9: + Engagement (Reactions) ‚úì
- Week 10: + Content Control (Edit/Delete) + Offline Reliability + Analytics ‚úì

### Parallel Team Strategy (7-8 Engineers)

With full team:

1. Setup + Foundational: All engineers (2 weeks)
2. After Foundational:
   - 2 engineers: US1 (P1 MVP)
   - 2 engineers: US2 (P1 MVP parallel)
   - 1 engineer: US3 Search (P2)
   - 1 engineer: US4 Stories (P2)
   - 2 FE engineers: US1+US2 components
3. After US1+US2 complete:
   - Rotate: Start US5, US6, US7, US8 in parallel
   - FE: Implement US3-8 components
