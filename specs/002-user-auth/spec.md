# Feature Specification: User Authentication System

**Feature Branch**: `002-user-auth`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "用户注册登录系统，支持Email和OAuth2"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Email Registration & Login (Priority: P1)

New users can create accounts using email and password, then log in to access the platform.

**Why this priority**: Core authentication is the foundation - no users can use any features without it. This is the absolute minimum viable authentication.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a test account, logging out, and logging back in. Delivers immediate value by securing the platform and enabling user identification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a new user on the app
   **When** I tap "Sign Up" and enter valid email, password (min 8 chars), and username
   **Then** I receive a verification email and can verify my account

2. **Given** I have a verified account
   **When** I enter correct email and password on login screen
   **Then** I am logged in and redirected to home feed

3. **Given** I am logged in
   **When** I tap "Log Out"
   **Then** I am returned to the login screen and my session is cleared

4. **Given** I enter an incorrect password 3 times
   **When** I attempt a 4th login
   **Then** I see a "Forgot Password?" link and account is temporarily locked (15 min)

### User Story 2 - OAuth2 Social Login (Priority: P2)

Users can sign up or log in using their Apple, Google, or Facebook accounts for faster onboarding.

**Why this priority**: Reduces friction for user acquisition. 70% of users prefer social login over email registration. Can be deployed after email auth is stable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by tapping "Continue with Apple" and verifying account creation/login works. Delivers faster onboarding experience.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a new user on the login screen
   **When** I tap "Continue with Apple" and authorize the app
   **Then** My account is created with Apple ID email and I'm logged in

2. **Given** I have an existing account linked to Google
   **When** I tap "Continue with Google" and authorize
   **Then** I am logged in to my existing account

3. **Given** I signed up with Email but later want to link social accounts
   **When** I go to Settings -> "Linked Accounts" and connect Apple ID
   **Then** I can log in using either method (email or Apple ID)

4. **Given** OAuth provider (e.g., Apple) returns an error
   **When** Authorization fails
   **Then** I see user-friendly error message and can retry or use email login

### User Story 3 - Password Recovery (Priority: P1)

Users who forget their password can reset it securely via email.

**Why this priority**: Critical for user retention. Without password recovery, users get locked out permanently. Must be included in MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking "Forgot Password?", receiving reset email, and successfully changing password.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I forgot my password
   **When** I tap "Forgot Password?" and enter my registered email
   **Then** I receive a password reset link via email (valid for 1 hour)

2. **Given** I received a password reset email
   **When** I click the link and enter a new password (min 8 chars)
   **Then** My password is updated and I can log in with the new password

3. **Given** The reset link has expired (>1 hour)
   **When** I try to use it
   **Then** I see "Link expired" message and option to request a new link

---

### User Story 4 - Account Security & 2FA (Priority: P3)

Security-conscious users can enable two-factor authentication for enhanced account protection.

**Why this priority**: Important for security but not blocking MVP. Can be added post-launch based on user demand and security audit recommendations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by enabling 2FA in settings, logging out, and verifying code is required on next login.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I want extra security
   **When** I go to Settings -> Security -> "Enable Two-Factor Authentication"
   **Then** I scan a QR code with authenticator app and enable 2FA

2. **Given** I have 2FA enabled
   **When** I log in with correct email/password
   **Then** I am prompted for 6-digit code from authenticator app

3. **Given** I lost access to my authenticator app
   **When** I use one of my backup codes
   **Then** I can access my account and am prompted to reconfigure 2FA

### Edge Cases

- **Email already registered**: When user tries to sign up with existing email, show "Email already in use. Log in instead?" with link to login
- **Weak password**: When user enters password <8 chars or common passwords (123456, password), show inline error "Password too weak. Use 8+ characters with mix of letters, numbers"
- **Email verification timeout**: If user doesn't verify email within 24 hours, allow resending verification email (max 3 times)
- **Concurrent sessions**: When user logs in on new device, allow multiple sessions but show "Active Sessions" in settings to manage devices
- **OAuth email mismatch**: If user's OAuth email differs from existing account email, prompt "Link this [Apple/Google] account to your existing account?" or "Create new account?"
- **Network failure during auth**: If API call fails, show "Connection error. Please try again" with retry button (auto-retry after 3s)
- **Invalid OAuth state/CSRF**: If OAuth callback has tampered state parameter, reject authentication and log security event
- **Account deletion compliance**: When user requests account deletion (Settings -> Delete Account), require re-authentication and show 30-day grace period before permanent deletion

- **Scalability**: System supports 100K registered users in Phase 1, with architecture ready for 10M+
- **Compliance**: 100% App Store review guideline compliance (privacy, account deletion, security)

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Assumptions
- Users have valid email addresses they can access
- Apple Sign In is available for iOS 13+ devices
- Users understand basic password security (system will educate via UI hints)
- Email delivery service (SendGrid/AWS SES) has 99% deliverability

### Dependencies
- **Email Service**: SendGrid, AWS SES, or similar for sending verification/reset emails
- **OAuth Providers**: Apple Developer account, Google Cloud Console, Facebook for Developers
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data, Redis for rate limiting and session management
- **Security Library**: bcrypt crate for password hashing, jsonwebtoken crate for JWT
- **Frontend**: iOS app with proper OAuth redirect URI configuration

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Passwordless authentication (magic links, WebAuthn)
- Biometric login (Face ID, Touch ID) - iOS-level, not backend
- Social graph import from OAuth providers
- Multi-organization/workspace support
- Enterprise SSO (SAML, LDAP)
- Adaptive authentication (risk-based challenges)

## Technical Constraints (from Constitution)

Per project constitution:
- **Language**: Rust for all backend services
- **Architecture**: Microservices - dedicated User Authentication Service
- **Security**: TLS 1.3+ for all API calls, secure secret management for OAuth keys
- **Testing**: TDD mandatory - tests written before implementation, 80% coverage minimum
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints + JWT bearer authentication
- **Deployment**: Containerized on Kubernetes with rolling updates

## Open Questions

None - all critical decisions have been made with reasonable defaults. If changes needed, they will be addressed during planning phase.
