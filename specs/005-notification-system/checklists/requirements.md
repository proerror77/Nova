# Specification Quality Checklist: 通知系统

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All items PASS** - Specification is ready for planning phase

## Notes

- Specification includes 5 prioritized user stories (P1-P2) covering like notifications, comment notifications, follow notifications, read status, and pagination
- 16 functional requirements provide complete contracts for notification system
- Key decisions: Three notification types (LIKE, COMMENT, FOLLOW), aggregation of multiple actions within 5 minutes, idempotent delivery
- Notification aggregation: Multiple likes from same user = single aggregated notification ("X liked your 3 posts")
- Read/unread management: Single mark, bulk mark all, unread count tracking
- Cleanup: Automatic deletion of notifications when post/follow is deleted
- Push notification support: With user preference settings (real-time, daily, weekly)
- Performance targets: Create and deliver < 2 seconds, list load < 200ms, mark as read < 100ms
- Dependencies: Triggered by Like/Comment System (003) and Follow System (004)
- Notification aggregation reduces noise while maintaining engagement

**Status**: READY FOR NEXT PHASE (`/speckit.plan`)
