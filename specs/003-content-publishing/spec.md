# Feature Specification: Content Publishing System

**Feature Branch**: `003-content-publishing`
**Created**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Complete ✅
**Input**: Image upload, processing, storage on S3/CDN

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Image Upload & Publishing (Priority: P1)

Users can capture or select photos from their device, add captions, and publish them to their feed for others to see.

**Why this priority**: Core content creation is fundamental to social platform. Without ability to publish content, platform is non-functional. This is absolute MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by taking/selecting photo, adding caption, publishing, and verifying it appears on profile with correct metadata. Delivers immediate value by enabling content creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am an authenticated user
   **When** I tap "+" and select a photo from camera roll
   **Then** I see image preview with option to add caption (max 2200 chars)

2. **Given** I have a photo selected with caption
   **When** I tap "Share"
   **Then** File uploads to S3, generates 3 variants, and appears on my profile feed with CloudFront URLs

3. **Given** I uploaded a photo 1 minute ago
   **When** I navigate to my profile
   **Then** The photo is visible with thumbnail preview (150x150px CloudFront URL)

4. **Given** I view a friend's post with original 4000x4000px image
   **When** I open image full-screen
   **Then** I see optimized medium version (600x600px) for faster loading

5. **Given** Upload fails due to network error
   **When** I tap "Retry"
   **Then** Upload resumes and completes successfully

---

### User Story 2 - Image Quality & Optimization (Priority: P1)

System automatically optimizes images for different display contexts (thumbnail on feed, medium in detail view, original for full-screen).

**Why this priority**: Critical for performance. Large unoptimized images destroy user experience (slow loads, battery drain). Must be included in MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying image sizes/quality via CDN URLs and checking load times on 3G network. Delivers significant performance improvement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I uploaded a 10MB raw photo from camera
   **When** Processing completes
   **Then** System stores 3 variants:
     - Thumbnail: 150x150px, 30KB max, CloudFront cached 1 year
     - Medium: 600x600px, 100KB max, CloudFront cached 1 year
     - Original: 4000x4000px, 2MB max, CloudFront cached 1 year

2. **Given** Image has non-square aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9)
   **When** Processing generates 150x150 thumbnail
   **Then** Image is letterboxed (not cropped) and preserves aspect ratio

3. **Given** Feed loads with 20 posts
   **When** Thumbnails render
   **Then** Total page size <2MB and loads in <2s on 3G (p95)

---

### User Story 3 - Post Metadata & Engagement (Priority: P2)

System tracks engagement metrics (likes, comments, views) on each post for feed ranking and social features.

**Why this priority**: Important for social features but not blocking MVP. Can be deployed after core publishing is stable. Enables later features like "For You" feed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by publishing post, checking initial metrics (0 likes/comments), and verifying they increment correctly. Delivers foundation for social algorithm.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I publish a new post
   **When** Post appears on feed
   **Then** Engagement metrics show: 0 likes, 0 comments, 1 view (my own)

2. **Given** 5 people have liked my post
   **When** I view post details
   **Then** Like count displays "5" and list shows their usernames

3. **Given** Friend comments on my post
   **When** I open post
   **Then** I see comment with timestamp and can reply

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve aspect ratio when resizing (letterbox, no crop)
- **FR-005**: System MUST upload processed variants to private S3 bucket with CloudFront distribution
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate CloudFront URLs for all variants: `https://cdn.domain.net/posts/{post_id}/{variant}.jpg`
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement retry logic for S3 failures (max 3 attempts, 1s delay)
- **FR-008**: System MUST process images asynchronously via background job queue (capacity: 100 jobs)

- **FR-010**: System MUST track post metadata (like_count, comment_count, view_count)
- **FR-011**: System MUST support soft deletes of posts (GDPR compliance, retention: 90 days)
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate file integrity via SHA256 hash before processing
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate upload-session tokens (1-hour expiry) to prevent replay attacks

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Image upload completes in <10 seconds for 5MB photo (p95 latency)
- **SC-002**: Image processing completes in <5 seconds after upload verified (p95)
- **SC-003**: Post appears on profile feed within 6 seconds of publishing
- **SC-004**: Thumbnail loads in <500ms on 3G network
- **SC-005**: Original image loads in <2s on 3G network
- **SC-006**: 100% of uploads are verified via SHA256 hash
- **SC-007**: 99.5% of image processing attempts succeed on first try
- **SC-008**: Zero image corruption or quality degradation
- **SC-009**: S3 upload failures are retried successfully in 95%+ of cases
- **SC-010**: Job queue handles 100 concurrent posts without dropping jobs
- **SC-011**: Post metrics (likes, comments) update within 1 second of interaction

### Non-Functional Success Criteria

- **Performance**: Image processing batch handles 1000 posts/hour
- **Reliability**: S3 upload success rate >99.9%
- **Scalability**: Architecture supports 100K posts/day in Phase 2, ready for 1M+/day in Phase 3
- **Security**: Zero unencrypted data in transit (TLS 1.3+), no plaintext files in S3
- **Cost**: S3 storage optimized (3 variants per post), CloudFront caching reduces bandwidth by 90%

## Architecture Decisions

### Image Processing Strategy
- **Local Processing**: Use pure Rust `image` crate (no external ImageMagick)
- **Async Workers**: Tokio background tasks with MPSC channel queue
- **Retry Mechanism**: 3 retries for S3 operations with exponential backoff

### S3 & CDN Strategy
- **S3 Structure**: `posts/{post_id}/{size_variant}.jpg`
- **Access Control**: Private S3 bucket, CloudFront OAI for public access
- **Caching**: 1-year cache (images immutable via content-addressed paths)
- **Cost**: Estimated 90% bandwidth reduction vs direct S3

### Database Strategy
- **Normalization**: 3NF normalized schema with proper foreign keys
- **Indexing**: Indexes on user_id, created_at, status for query performance
- **Soft Deletes**: GDPR compliance with retention policy
- **Post Metadata**: Separate table for engagement stats (efficient aggregation queries)

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Assumptions
- iOS app can handle presigned URL uploads to S3
- Users have sufficient mobile data to upload photos
- CloudFront distribution is already configured
- Background jobs can process 100 concurrent tasks
- Database can handle 100K+ posts

### Dependencies
- **AWS S3**: Image storage, presigned URLs
- **AWS CloudFront**: CDN distribution, 1-year caching
- **Image Processing**: `image` crate 0.24+ for resizing
- **Job Queue**: Tokio MPSC channels for async tasks
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for post/metadata storage
- **Redis**: Session management, upload token tracking (optional, can use DB)

### Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)
- Image filters/editing within app
- Multi-image carousel posts
- Video support
- Live streaming
- Image recognition/auto-tagging
- Smart cropping based on ML

## Technical Constraints (from Constitution)

Per project constitution:
- **Language**: Rust for backend
- **Architecture**: Microservices with async workers
- **Storage**: AWS S3 + CloudFront (no local storage)
- **Testing**: TDD - 80%+ coverage minimum
- **API Design**: RESTful, JSON responses, proper HTTP status codes
- **Performance**: <500ms p95 latency for most operations

## Open Questions

None - architecture validated and implementation complete.
