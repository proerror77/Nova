## Overview

Nova is an Instagram-like social media platform. This specification defines the **core social infrastructure** required to make multi-content forms (Posts, Reels, Stories, Live, DM) work together as a cohesive social experience, not as isolated features.

**Key Principle**: Everything is driven by **user relationships** and **real-time interactions**. Features succeed because they connect people, not because they have advanced technology.

---

## Core Features

### 1. **Social Graph** (Relationships)
- Relationship model: Follow/Followers with proper indexing
- Privacy controls: Block, Mute, custom visibility settings
- Recommendation foundation: Suggest follows based on mutual connections
- Integrity: No self-follows, cascade deletes, temporal tracking

### 2. **Unified Content Model**
All content forms (Posts, Reels, Stories, Live, DM) support:
- Multi-type content in a single feed (not separate feeds)
- Common interactions: Like, Comment, Share, Save (where applicable)
- Consistent metadata: Creator, timestamp, engagement counts
- Lifecycle management: Creation ‚Üí Visibility ‚Üí Archival/Deletion

### 3. **Real-Time Interactions** (WebSocket Layer)
- Event broadcasting: Any social action ‚Üí instant push to relevant users
- Channels: Per-stream (live), per-user (notifications), global (trending)
- Reliable delivery: Reconnection logic, heartbeat monitoring
- Distributed: Support for multi-server deployments (Redis Pub/Sub)

### 4. **Feed & Discovery**
- **For You Feed**: Personalized ranking (Posts + Reels + Stories + Lives mixed)
- **Following Feed**: Chronological + engagement-weighted from people you follow
- **Discovery Page**: Trending, categories, search across users/content/tags
- **Real-time trending**: What's being watched/liked/shared right now

### 5. **Creator Monetization**
- Gift/tip during live streams (real-time transactions)
- Fan subscriptions (recurring revenue, exclusive content access)
- Analytics dashboard: Viewers, engagement, revenue metrics
- Income distribution: Creator gets share, platform takes fee

### 6. **Content Safety & Moderation**
- User reporting: Content/user reports with triage
- Automated filtering: Spam, harmful content, policy violations

## Assumptions

1. **Social Model**: Nova follows the Instagram model (public by default, but with privacy controls). Users are primarily public figures or willing to be semi-public.

2. **Content Processing**: Image and video transcoding is handled by external services (S3 + FFmpeg + CloudFront). Spec assumes these are available.

3. **Real-Time Scale**: For MVP, <100k concurrent users. Beyond that, Redis Pub/Sub is required for distributed WebSocket.

4. **Monetization**: Payments are processed via Stripe/PayPal (details in Phase 3-4). MVP focuses on architecture, not payment integration.

5. **Moderation**: Content moderation starts with user reporting and manual review (Phase 2-3). Automated ML-based filtering comes in Phase 5+.

6. **Authentication**: OAuth2 + JWT is handled in Phase 1 (authentication service exists). This spec assumes users are authenticated.

7. **Analytics**: ClickHouse is the source of truth for analytics queries. PostgreSQL is for operational data.

8. **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, ClickHouse for analytics, Redis for real-time caching.

## Out of Scope (For Future Phases)

- Automated content moderation (ML-based filtering) - Phase 5+
- Video editing tools on client - Phase 4+
- Advanced creator tools (scheduling, drafts, analytics export) - Phase 3+
- Ads/sponsorships - Phase 4+
- Live gifting with custom animations - Phase 3+
- Stories with advanced effects - Phase 3+
- Full-text search - Phase 4+
- Trending algorithm machine learning - Phase 5+
