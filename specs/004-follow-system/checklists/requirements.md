# Specification Quality Checklist: 用户关注系统

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All items PASS** - Specification is ready for planning phase

## Notes

- Specification includes 4 prioritized user stories (P1-P2) covering follow toggle, unfollow, follower/following lists, and mutual follow indication
- 15 functional requirements provide comprehensive contracts for follow functionality
- Key decision: Toggle model (follow/unfollow button), no self-follow constraint, mutual follows allowed
- Denormalized counts (follower_count, following_count) included for performance on user profiles
- Follower/following lists: Paginated (20 per page), include is_following and is_followed_by flags
- Notification integration: Triggers notification when user receives new follower (Notification System 005)
- Cascading deletion: Account deletion removes all follow records automatically
- Dependencies: Core foundation for Feed Query System (002) and Notification System (005)
- Performance: < 200ms for follow/unfollow, < 500ms for list queries with 100k+ followers

**Status**: READY FOR NEXT PHASE (`/speckit.plan`)
