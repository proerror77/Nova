# Specification Quality Checklist: 图片贴文发布与存储系统

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **All items PASS** - Specification is ready for planning phase

## Notes

- Specification includes 6 prioritized user stories (P1-P2) covering core upload workflow and resilience patterns
- 15 functional requirements provide clear contracts for implementation
- API preview included to align frontend/backend expectations
- Out-of-scope section clearly defines boundaries (multi-image, video, editing, etc.)
- Assumptions documented for async processing model and eventual consistency
- All edge cases account for error scenarios and data integrity concerns

**Status**: READY FOR NEXT PHASE (`/speckit.plan`)
