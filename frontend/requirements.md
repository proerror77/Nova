# Design System & Multi-Brand Theming - Requirements Document

Cross-platform design system (iOS SwiftUI + Android Compose) supporting 2 brands (BrandA/BrandB) with light/dark themes. Unified tokens with 8pt grid, Instagram-like IA, no trade dress violations.

## Core Features

1. **Unified Design Tokens** - Single source of truth for colors, typography, spacing, metrics across iOS & Android
2. **Multi-Brand Support** - BrandA (Blue) & BrandB (Coral) with instant switching
3. **Dark/Light Themes** - 8 theme combinations (2 brands × 2 modes × 2 platforms)
4. **Cross-Platform Consistency** - Identical design semantics via Tokens Studio JSON
5. **Platform-Native Implementation** - SwiftUI (iOS) + Jetpack Compose (Android)

## User Stories

- As a designer, I want to manage all tokens in one place (Figma), so that brand changes propagate instantly to both apps
- As an iOS developer, I want pre-built Theme.swift with environment injection, so that I can switch themes in 1 line
- As an Android developer, I want Compose-ready theme objects with Material3 integration, so that components auto-adapt
- As a PM, I want to A/B test brand themes in production, so that I can decide which brand resonates better

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] tokens.design.json exported from Figma Tokens Studio (4 themes, 11 color families, 3 type scales, 6 spaces, 3 radii, 2 motions)
- [ ] iOS: 4 xcassets color groups + Theme.swift with @Environment injection working end-to-end
- [ ] Android: colors.xml/dimens.xml/Theme.kt (Compose) with Material3 integration
- [ ] Both platforms support theme switching without app restart
- [ ] All 8 combinations visually tested (BrandA/B × Light/Dark on both platforms)
- [ ] Integration guide + code examples for both platforms

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Theme initialization < 16ms (60fps on slow devices)
- **Maintainability**: Single token change syncs to all 8 theme variants automatically
- **Consistency**: Zero visual drift between iOS & Android for same token
- **Scalability**: Support adding 3rd brand/5th theme without restructuring
