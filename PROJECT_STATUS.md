## 🎯 Phase 7A Week 1 Status: READY FOR FEATURE DEVELOPMENT

### ✅ Completed Deliverables

#### 1. Code Repository Cleanup
- **Removed**: 56GB+ of build artifacts and generated documentation
- **Files Deleted**: 263+ obsolete files
- **Branches**: All cleanup work committed to `chore/cleanup-obsolete-docs`

#### 2. Git Workflow Reorganization
Successfully reorganized 12 commits from main into feature branches:

| Branch | Commits | Content |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/backend-architecture-phases` | 4 | Backend phases 2-5 implementation |
| `feature/k8s-deployment` | 4 | Kubernetes infrastructure setup |
| `feature/ios-component-architecture` | 1 | iOS component refactoring |
| `docs/database-architecture` | 1 | Multi-database schema design |
| `chore/cleanup-obsolete-docs` | 2 | Archive cleanup |

**Status**: All branches pushed to origin, ready for PR review

#### 3. Branch Protection & Git Hooks
- **Pre-push Hook**: Prevents direct pushes to main
- **Configuration File**: `.githooks/pre-push`
- **Setup Documentation**: `SETUP.md` with team instructions
- **Enforcement Level**: Local (client-side) - prevents accidental commits
- **Team Coordination**: Required configuration = `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

#### 4. Local Kubernetes Infrastructure
- **Status**: Operational (primary services running)
- **Redis Sentinel**: ✅ Running (replica set)
- **PostgreSQL**: ✅ Primary running, replica pending
- **Namespaces Created**:
  - `nova-redis` - Message queue
  - `nova-database` - Data persistence
  - `nova-services` - Application services
  - `nova-secrets` - Credentials management

**Known Issues**:
- etcd: CrashLoopBackOff (non-critical for development)
- PostgreSQL replica: Pending (resource constraints)

#### 5. iOS Component Architecture
- **Status**: Complete refactoring on `feature/ios-component-architecture`
- **Components Extracted**: 10 major components
- **Design System**: Centralized Figma design tokens
- **Code Reduction**: ContentView reduced 75% (400+ → <100 lines)
- **Ready For**: Feature development with real data models

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 7A Week 2+)

### Immediate Actions (This Week)
1. **Team Setup**
   - [ ] All developers run: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`
   - [ ] Each developer reads `SETUP.md`
   - [ ] Test the workflow on a practice branch

2. **Feature Branch PRs**
   - [ ] Review open PRs from branch reorganization
   - [ ] Merge PRs in recommended order:
     1. Backend Architecture (feature/backend-architecture-phases)
     2. K8s Deployment (feature/k8s-deployment)
     3. iOS Components (feature/ios-component-architecture)
     4. Database Docs (docs/database-architecture)
     5. Cleanup (chore/cleanup-obsolete-docs)

3. **Infrastructure Validation**
   - [ ] Test Redis connectivity: `kubectl port-forward svc/redis-service 6379:6379 -n nova-redis`
   - [ ] Test PostgreSQL: `kubectl port-forward svc/postgres-primary 5432:5432 -n nova-database`
   - [ ] Investigate etcd CrashLoopBackOff if needed

### Feature Development (Weeks 2-4)
- **Feature 1**: Real-time Notification System (Kafka + FCM/APNs)
- **Feature 2**: Private Messaging System (Elasticsearch + WebSocket)
- **Feature 3**: Video Live Streaming (RTMP + HLS)
- **Feature 4**: Social Graph Optimization (Neo4j + Redis)
- **Feature 5**: Recommendation Algorithm v2.0 (ML/PyTorch)

**Timeline**: 20 weeks total (Nov 2025 - Mar 2026)
