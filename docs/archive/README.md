# Archive Policy

This `docs/archive/` folder preserves full historical documents while keeping the main tree focused on authoritative sources.

- Root duplicates moved from the repository root live under `docs/archive/root/`.
- iOS historical backups were moved from `ios/NovaSocial.backup/` to `docs/archive/ios/NovaSocial.backup/`.
- Canonical iOS docs live under `ios/NovaSocialApp/`. The legacy `ios/NovaSocial/` remains for reference.

Notes
- No content is deleted; only relocated for clarity.
- New work should reference canonical docs listed in `docs/INDEX.md`.
