## 🎯 Key Difference: Original vs Revised

### Original Roadmap (89.5h)
- Phase 1: Authentication only
- Minimal features beyond auth
- Estimated 2 weeks of development

### Revised Roadmap (156.5h based on PRD)
- Phase 1-8: Complete Instagram MVP
- Phase 9-12: Testing, optimization, frontend, hardening
- Comprehensive feature set with all PRD requirements
- Realistic 8-10 week timeline

### Why the Difference?

The provided Instagram PRD includes:
1. ✅ User authentication (completed in Phase 1)
2. 📋 Image publishing with transcoding
3. 📋 Social feeds with follow logic
4. 📋 Likes and comments
5. 📋 User profiles and search
6. 📋 Push notifications
7. 📋 Apple Sign-in
8. 📋 Account deletion (GDPR)

Plus comprehensive testing and iOS frontend development.

## 📋 Phase 2: Content Publishing (Next)

### Quick Overview
- **Duration**: 12 hours
- **Status**: Ready to start
- **Endpoints**: 3 (upload, complete, get)
- **Tests**: 25 unit tests
- **Key Feature**: Image upload to S3 with automatic transcoding

### What Gets Built

1. **Presigned URL Endpoint**
   - Generate time-limited S3 upload URLs
   - Return: upload_url, post_id, upload_token

2. **Complete Upload Endpoint**
   - Finalize upload after file reaches S3
   - Trigger image transcoding
   - Return: post with 3 image URLs (thumbnail, medium, original)

3. **Get Post Endpoint**
   - Retrieve post with all image URLs
   - Support for pagination (in Phase 3)

### Technical Additions

**Dependencies**:
- `aws-sdk-s3` - AWS S3 integration
- `sha2` - File integrity verification
- `mime` - MIME type detection

**Database**:
- `posts` table (user_id, caption, image_key, created_at, etc)
- `post_images` table (tracking transcoding status)

**AWS**:
- S3 bucket for image storage
- IAM policy for backend access
- Lambda function for image transcoding (optional: local processing)
