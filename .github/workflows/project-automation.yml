# Setup instructions:
# 1) Create a Projects v2 board (e.g., https://github.com/users/<user>/projects/<n>)
# 2) Store its URL in a repository variable: Settings → Variables → Actions → NOVA_PROJECT_URL
# 3) Create a fine-grained PAT with project read/write and repo scopes; add as secret PROJECTS_TOKEN
# 4) This workflow will add new issues and ready PRs to the board
