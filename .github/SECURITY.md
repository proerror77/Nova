# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We aim to support the latest `main` and the most recent tagged release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not file public issues for security problems. Instead, report vulnerabilities privately:

1. Use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" on the repository Security tab, or
2. Email the maintainer (see profile for contact).

Provide as much detail as possible to reproduce and assess the impact. We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and keep you informed of the remediation progress.
