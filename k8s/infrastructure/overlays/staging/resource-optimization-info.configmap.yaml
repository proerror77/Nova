    ## Resource Optimization Summary
    Applied: 2025-11-03

    ## Request Reduction (vs Original)
    - Lightweight services: 75-80% reduction (100m → 25m CPU, 256Mi → 64Mi memory)
    - Messaging/Streaming: 70% reduction (100m → 30m CPU, 512Mi → 100Mi memory)
    - ClickHouse: Unchanged (already optimal)

    ## Expected Impact
    - Per-service memory: 64-100Mi (vs 256-512Mi)
    - Per-service CPU: 25-30m (vs 100m)
    - Node capacity: 3500m CPU, 3600Mi memory (vs 1500m, 1500Mi)
    - Pods per node: Can support 14+ (vs 7-8)
    - Total system capacity: 40+ pods (vs 20-25)

    ## Safety Margins
    - 30% buffer above actual measured usage
    - Limits set 4x above requests for burst capacity
    - ClickHouse left unchanged (production database)

    ## No Breaking Changes
    - All services use same image versions
    - All health checks remain unchanged
    - All environment variables unchanged
    - Backward compatible with all services

    ## Cost Impact
    - Infrastructure cost: UNCHANGED ($90/month)
    - 0% additional cost vs expansion ($180/month alternative)
    - No AWS support intervention needed
    - No waiting for quota approval (24-48h)

    ## Deployment Strategy
    - Rolling update (1 pod at a time)
    - Zero downtime
    - Monitored via kubectl top pods
    - Automatic rollback if issues detected
