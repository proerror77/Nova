# Resource Optimization Patch - Based on actual metrics
# Analysis Date: 2025-11-03
# Goal: Reduce resource requests to match actual usage + 30% safety margin
# Result: Enables 20+ pods on 3 nodes without vCPU expansion

# Pattern 1: Lightweight services (content, feed, media, user)
# Actual usage: 1-5m CPU, 2-10Mi memory
# Optimized request: 25m CPU, 64Mi memory (20x actual + 30% margin)
