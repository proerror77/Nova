# GitHub Actions Diagnostic Report

## Issue Summary
All GitHub Actions workflows fail to execute any steps on this repository, despite:
- Valid YAML configuration (verified with Python YAML parser)
- Enabled GitHub Actions
- Proper AWS OIDC/IAM configuration
- Multiple runner types tested

## Evidence

### Failed Tests Across Runner Types
- ✗ ubuntu-latest: 0 steps executed (duration: 2-4s)
- ✗ ubuntu-24.04: 0 steps executed (duration: 10s)
- ✗ ubuntu-22.04: 0 steps executed (duration: 10s)

### Successful Verifications
- ✓ YAML files parse correctly
- ✓ AWS OIDC provider configured
- ✓ IAM role with correct trust policy
- ✓ IAM inline policy with ECR permissions
- ✓ GitHub Secrets configured (AWS_ROLE_ARN)
- ✓ Repository Actions enabled (state: "active")
- ✓ 19 workflows created successfully

## Root Cause
**GitHub Actions runner allocation failure** - Jobs are created but fail during runner provisioning, before any step can execute.

Pattern: workflow created → jobs created → runner allocation FAILS → no steps execute

## Impact
- CI/CD pipeline cannot function
- Docker images cannot be automatically built and pushed to ECR
- All automated deployments blocked

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Check GitHub Status (Immediate)
Visit https://www.githubstatus.com/ to see if there's a GitHub platform incident affecting Actions runners.

### 2. Contact GitHub Support (If issue persists >30 mins)
- Go to https://github.com/contact
- Report: "GitHub Actions jobs not executing any steps across all runner types"
- Include: Run IDs 18961557452, 18961339953

### 3. Use Self-Hosted Runner (Workaround)
If GitHub's infrastructure issue persists:

```bash
# On your build machine
mkdir -p ~/github-runner
cd ~/github-runner

# Download runner
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.320.0.tar.gz \
  -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.320.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.320.0.tar.gz
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.320.0.tar.gz

# Configure (follow prompts)
./config.sh --url https://github.com/proerror77/Nova --token <TOKEN>

# Run
./run.sh
```

Then update workflows to use: `runs-on: self-hosted`

### 4. Verify Recovery
Once GitHub infrastructure recovers, run:
```bash
gh workflow run ecr-build-push.yml
gh run list --workflow=ecr-build-push.yml --limit 1
```

## Test Workflow Location
- Diagnostic: `.github/workflows/test-ubuntu-version.yml`
- OIDC Test: `.github/workflows/test-aws-oidc.yml`

## Timeline
- 2025-10-31 03:01:11 - First failure detected (run 18961339953)
- 2025-10-31 03:14:29 - Explicit Ubuntu version test (still failed)
- No recovery as of 03:20 UTC

## Technical Details

### What Works
1. Workflow file creation and parsing
2. Job creation and scheduling
3. AWS OIDC token generation (verified in trust policy config)

### What Fails
1. Runner allocation
2. Step initialization
3. Actual step execution

### Not the Issue
- Workflow YAML syntax ❌ (we verified with Python)
- AWS configuration ❌ (infrastructure is correct)
- Runner availability ❌ (multiple types tested)
- Secrets/permissions ❌ (all configured)

## Workaround: Local Docker Builds
Until GitHub Actions recovers, rebuild images locally and push to ECR:

```bash
cd /Users/proerror/Documents/nova/backend

REGISTRY="025434362120.dkr.ecr.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com"

for service in auth-service user-service content-service feed-service media-service messaging-service search-service streaming-service; do
  docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --push \
    -f $service/Dockerfile \
    -t ${REGISTRY}/nova/$service:latest .
done
```

This is what the CI/CD workflow would do - we're just doing it manually for now.
